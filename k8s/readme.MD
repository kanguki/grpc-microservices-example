# amateur k8s user here ðŸ˜„

I'm not familiar with k8s, it may look noob. I'll be back some day (?) to make it look less silly ðŸ˜„

# steps to work with this stuff:

```sh
make deploy
```

```sh
./sh/check.sh
```

```sh
make clean
```

# dev note

###### [services.yaml](services.yaml) seems to have a lot of duplicated work

I know, may come back to use helm later when I'm bored ðŸ¥²
